SYNDICATE
=========

**A Scalable Data Storage and Delivery Platform**

Syndicate a general-purpose data delivery platform that harnesses a collection of existing storage components to provide a global, scalable, and secure storage service. These include public and private cloud storage (for data durability), network caches and content distribution networks (for scalable read bandwidth), and local disks (for local read/write performance). Syndicate's goal is to allow applications to access data independent of where it is stored, while both minimizing the operational overhead imposed on users and maximizing the use of commodity infrastructure.
